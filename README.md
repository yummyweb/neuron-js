# Neuron JS

## Description

Neuron JS is the server-side framework you are waiting for. It's as elegant and easy to use as Express JS but at the same time much more smooth and experiential. With an MVC-like architecture whether you are coming from PHP or Django, this framework is suited to your needs.

## Install

`npm i @yummyweb/neuronjs`

## Usage

```
const neuron = require('neuronjs')

const neuronjs = neuron()

const server = neuronjs.listen(5000, () => console.log(`Server running on ${5000}`))
```

Check out the GitHub repository of the project to see some more examples.
